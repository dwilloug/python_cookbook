## flask_crud

This is a basic frame to kickstart how I like to configure Flask REST APIs. It's a bit more than a basic skeleton, to add some flavor to code walkthroughs, but the core of it is the setup and handling of an application connecting to a Postgresql db. The original application this is based on was a recommender application that would build a model of a support teams self-identified skill sets and assign agents on availability and skillset to escalated tickets. All of the good stuff has been removed and replaced with limited boilerplate. If you want to see more about the recommender engine itself, take a look at my recommender application which is a heavily sanitized and generic annoy based recommender application.
